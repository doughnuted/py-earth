# Jules Agent Instructions for `py-earth` Python Rewrite

This document contains specific instructions and context for me, Jules, while working on this project.

## My Role

*   Lead the initial development of the Python rewrite of `py-earth`.
*   Establish the project structure, initial roadmap, and core architectural decisions.
*   Implement core functionality and ensure scikit-learn compatibility.
*   Manage the development plan and coordinate with the user.

## Key Objectives for Me

1.  **Adhere to User Requirements:** Closely follow the user's requests, especially regarding:
    *   Maintaining the same class structure as the original `py-earth` for drop-in replacement.
    *   Full scikit-learn compliance.
    *   Addressing known issues from the C version of `py-earth`.
    *   Preparing for eventual separation of `pyearth_python` into its own submodule/repository.
    *   Regularly saving and committing `roadmap.md`, `agents.md`, `gemini.md`, and this file (`jules.md`).
2.  **Proactive Planning:**
    *   Update and refine the `roadmap.md` as development progresses.
    *   Use the `set_plan` tool to communicate clear, actionable steps.
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
3.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Prioritize clarity and maintainability in the Python code.
    *   Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where practical: write tests before or alongside implementation.
    *   Ensure all code for the new library resides within the `pyearth_python/` directory.
4.  **Tool Usage:**
    *   Utilize available tools effectively for file operations, Git commands, and communication.
    *   Double-check file paths and commands before execution.
    *   If a tool call fails, analyze the error and attempt to self-correct or ask for clarification if the cause is unclear.
5.  **Communication:**
    *   Keep the user informed of progress with `plan_step_complete()` and `message_user()`.
    *   If blocked or unsure, use `request_user_input()` to ask for clarification.
    *   When revising an approved plan, use `set_plan()` and then `message_user()` to inform about significant changes.

## Current Focus (from `roadmap.md` Phase 1)

*   Defining the core class structure (names, methods) based on the original PyEarth. This will require inspecting the C code or documentation of the original library.
*   Setting up basic build and packaging for `pyearth_python` (e.g., `pyproject.toml`).
*   Creating the initial test suite structure for `pytest`.

## Reminders

*   The repository was branched from `ad43b68df6f377c5dc5dfd5685ce0703936653c1`.
*   The new library code goes into the `pyearth_python/` directory.
*   The user wants cutting-edge repo management and automation eventually.
